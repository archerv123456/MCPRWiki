The <code>\"name\"</code> is the name id of the effect MAKE SURE IT NOT SOMETHING THAT ALREADY EXISTS, It WILL make a conflict if you do. Also make sure there are no special characters (_, !, ., etc.), or uppercase keys.</p> <p>The <code>new MobEffect()</code> part creates the effect itself, the <code>MobEffectCategory</code> within the <code>new MobEffect()</code> determines if its on the top row (BENEFICIAL) or bottom row (NEUTRAL/HARMFUL), the <code>3402751</code> is just the color in decimal.</p> <p>From there you can start the game, and give yourself the effect!
